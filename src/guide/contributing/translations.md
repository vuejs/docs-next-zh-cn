# 翻译

Vue 在全球被广泛使用，核心团队成员身处至少 6 个不同时区。社区一直在成长，我们希望让尽可能多的人能够获得文档。

为文档提供翻译并不是核心团队能够单独管理的。值得庆幸的是，我们有一个伟大的译者社区，为项目做出了大大小小的贡献。如果你一直在考虑为项目做贡献，也许这里是一个很好的开始。

## 社区翻译

The table below lists GitHub repositories for community translations. These are translations made by the community, for the community. Some of these translations may be incomplete but they can still make the Vue experience significantly more enjoyable for readers who prefer these languages.

For completeness, we've also included the official documentation in the list.

<guide-contributing-translations />

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to these translations. Your hard work is very much appreciated.

## 我如何参与翻译？

The first step is to check whether there is an existing translation for the relevant language. In addition to the table above, a good place to start is [this pinned issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/478), which is used to keep track of the various translation initiatives happening in the community.

If there's already an active translation then there are various ways you can help out. The GitHub repository should be a good place to start gathering information about how a particular translation is managed and who does what. All translation repositories should allow you to file issues and open Pull Requests if you have suggestions for improving the translation.

## What if there isn't an existing translation?

If you want to start a new translation then please do. You don't need our permission to start but you should read the rest of this page carefully to make sure you're clear about what's involved.

Before you start, you might want to check whether there was a community translation for Vue 2. [This pinned issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/issues/2015) from the Vue 2 documentation may help.

Working on a translation is more fun, and more likely to succeed, if there are multiple contributors. Even if you don't know anyone personally who can help out you may be able to find other translators from within the Vue community.

The documentation is constantly being updated. Many changes are small and don't directly impact the translations but others make important improvements that also need translating. Before you start work on a new translation you may want to take a look at the GitHub repositories for some other languages to get a sense of how they handle the update process.

When you first start a translation, you may want to use a personal GitHub repository. That's fine, so long as it's publicly accessible and open to contributions from others. Make sure the *Issues* tab is enabled in the repository's settings. You can migrate the repository to a shared organization at a later stage.

Once you start a translation, be sure to add it to [the pinned issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/478) so that the rest of the community can find it.

We also encourage you to update the root-level `README.md` at an early stage. Most translations add extra information to help potential contributors get involved.

## Can I add my translation to this page?

If you've translated more than half of the documentation then please open a Pull Request to add your repository to the table of community translations on this page.

The official documentation is deployed on [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/HJ8X2mxP8). We encourage you to do the same. Some community translators use their own Netlify accounts but we're happy to host community translations on our account once they're at an advanced stage.
